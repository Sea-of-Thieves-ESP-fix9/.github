## 🔥 What Does ESP Do in Sea of Thieves?

ESP is like a **radar that lives on your screen**, showing you the exact location of:

* 🎯 Players (distance, direction, status)
* 🚢 Ships (sloops, brigs, galleons, rowboats)
* 💰 Treasure (chests, skulls, cargo, keys)
* ☠️ AI (skeletons, phantoms, bosses, waves)
* 🔐 Traps (powder barrels, skeleton ambushes)
* 🧭 Map Events (active Forts, World Events, etc.)

Everything appears with **names, icons, and colored boxes**, so you can play smarter — not harder.
